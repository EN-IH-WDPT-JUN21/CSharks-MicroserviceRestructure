<h1>Project Specification</h1>

<h3>Requirements </h3>

As a team, decide the best microservice architecture. Consider where edge services might be advantageous and necessary individual services. Make sure that you are designing together how the application will be broken into services before starting.

Then, rebuild the exact project from the ground up utilizing microservices architecture and creating API routes for every current CLI command.

Remember to make the application as robust as possible.
